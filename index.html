Yes. But you never saw the way I went crawling through intactile places. Those shades that spoke in shapes. Soft fingers of my own climbing up my thighs. You never saw it either: the starlight in the North, where they pulse in blues in the sky of silence, and the pines standing eerie in the dark. The lakes blurred by the stars like a crown of silver light. But, that was before this. Before a vacuum of a city sent souls teetering like I into the drowning floods. And, all those figures of life have faded. And I am lost, in the alleys full of rain. Murderous cold rain that never stops . I watch people pass and pass, and, he recites to me, as we lay here, that all things are falling and fading, all things are going away. The rain: falling on the cold of my lips. Flash of my bone structure, the webs of my veins. His vacant eyes murmur the same thing. Cycle after cycle. Cold thought after cold thought. Speaks in pictures, my memory speaks; of the northern woods, the twilights of many colours. The depth of night like depth of soul. Now the sick wander around me. Black streets and skeltering whips of thought climb up my spine and the running rain in the gutters and what has ordained that pulse of knowing between the daily gray. When you have been thinking of someone, from so long ago, and there, they appear. That pulse, it fades so fast. Like powerful dreams fade with something we ought not see. That world hiding, before all of us were born that world was: 
	 Music with no sound. Black suns eating streams of matter, curling energy forms heaving in agency and falling into each other without names of destruction, without sight to see it, sightless and soundless and nameless music unfolding and breaking in lightless light. Like thoughts I never had talking amongst themselves. He recites things like me: 

Wrath now brims into my eyes dark like the depth of the night. He murmurs and a dagger inside me slashes left to right. I have scratched a stone until my nails bleed. Speak stone, speak or bleed. Mothlike. They hold to trees in the firelight. Then out drinking and drinking, and falling and falling and spinning and spinning and my head against the floor. 
	My sister held there in my dreams with moth wings painted on her palms and her hot green eyes in the cracks of her fingers. I wore that black dress for him before the noxious powers came to take me in the alleys. Blood moving so slow.
	Mirror of me: 
		Psoriasis on my skin and raising my arms up wildly. Trance bemused in this hot sickness. Her eyes behind the painted moths. wrath of lostness. Take my bones for she is blonde and her eyes are so much more beautiful. Yes. I am the night feeding thing and she is the sun and the day. That thing I am, the thing that flies into flames. 
	When we were young we saw a farmhouse on fire in northern Ontario. The dark smoke and everyone screaming and I cried and I cried as a storm was coming in above the flames. That night, she came into my room and climbed under the sheets and held me so soft. I wept from how soft she held, and, she told me that a fire is not a fire. Nor a storm a storm. But is a killer a killer? Where do killers go? Who's to doom. If the judge is only me and you?
	We went west. 
	Sphinx moths clung to the lampposts at the bus stop. On the ride I told her about dreams of bears and cats in the forests. That I had a place in my stomach full of images that I could not explain. And any attempt to speak them to the world was ruinous. Out there. She left me then. 
	We split. 
	She in marble palaces. I alone to drink and walk down the silk-rain roads carrying cold embers, and a manifesto brimming in my head. Consigned to strange fires. Her tongue mocked my every step. Skelter in the night. Do you see me? Waitress with butterflies all over your skin. Nameless music. Drink one, Drink two. Tower of ivory, house of gold . Gas-town blonde, Then out where the water wells reflect the stars. Out where the wind keeps the killers whisper and the fireflies glow. I am out, the faun is lost in the reeds, crying for mother, slaking dogs with thirst-honed eyes follow her scent and the faun under the speckled beetle of the indifferent sky. My heart is beating wildly. Tongue dry and paralyzed before they find me. Sink your teeth into me..  
	I thought I could breath the streets into me. That I could have them for my own and they would be my own. They would fall before me. That I could have them and they would be my own. They would fall before me. The face of fire is here in the alley. Coiled around him is the limitless darkness, trembling like matterless systems. Black heaven heaves in my brain. 
	I saw her out there bathing in neon light. Laughing and dancing and coloured and I saw her and everything shot out. A folding shore, clawing its way into my skull and exploding and I was ripped to shreds. I fell to the ground and could not breathe and the was from the sky and it filled my bones. It would not go away. Shaking in the rain, the clouds filling up and falling, like cold girls on the back of my neck, like liquid beings speechless and silent filling with world with soft noise. 
	He keeps murmuring. Cycle after cycle. Cold thought after cold thought. 
	
Come back, memory. 
	Speak:
	In a canoe in the dark and quiet. Northern woods. Where I would sneak away with one of them. The sky so full of stars. Like a mother with a million babies. God it was so beautiful it filled me with a rage. I wished I had a knife and I and I could cut the black velvet of it open and drink the blood to become as beautiful as it. I opened my legs for him and my arms went back. It made me shiver and I went to wash it off in the lake. Silence in the bottom. Cold and alone in that vastness, only my head rattling like a storm. I came to him with the lake on me, backed by the night and I told him. I am your annihilation. He laughed. I thought to grab a rock and bash his head in. The face in the alleys then filled me that night. The man in all our history working his cold and terror through my every cell. The wrath of a storm from a dream where a figure had spoken to me. Telling me that all I was warned of will come to pass. Life. Unfolding. The head is a great house for lies. 
	
	Under the bridge, now. That is where I sleep. The bugs come and nip at me. Near Abbot St. Afflicted daggers of thought crowded me. Skipping through arctic growthless regions. Under whitespread wings I will give you the keys. A figure, he watches. He knows. Fee, fi, fo, fum. 
	I can seem him now. Across the way, tending me with his horror. I look away but I know I cannot. But, what can I tell you. She was the end and the beginning. And the blood that dripped when I saw it falling I wanted to take it back but the colours were lost. She consumed the empty air. It left and she was and was not again. So.() Rain. 
	The night birds are calling on the shore. I had come pale out of the water like a djinn steaming in flesh for him and standing on the throne of life and death. 
	The rain. Is falling. I feel that I could nearly fall away. Into the deeps. If you see him. Not when you are awake, and not when you are dreaming. Only then you will know. For what has has come already. And what has past is coming for you. What you did will be done. 
	And then I did it. The storms cry out like raped girls, burn does thunder like a madmans mind, rails of rain overflow me, flood me like basement captive, hot blood coats my legs. Arkangels. Tell me. What is the last swerve of my name? What becomes of everyone? And I did it. I did it. Time. You will see. What becomes of me? Farewell. Velvet softness, the body growing stranger, temple pulsing. My skin is still glowing with the flushes of youth, he will show me his power when he takes it away. 
 
		Her eyes were so beautiful. More than anything in the world. That villain of her beauty. The coldness of it. The knowing of it. It made my stomach ache. Though she held me. I.
