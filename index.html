Yes. But you never saw the way I went crawling through intactile places. Those shades that spoke in shapes. Soft fingers of my own climbing up my thighs. You never saw it either: the starlight in the North, where they pulse in blues in the sky of silence, and the pines standing eerie in the dark. The lakes blurred by the stars like a crown of silver light. But, that was before this. Before a vacuum of a city sent souls teetering like I into the drowning floods. And, all those figures of life have faded. And I am lost, in the alleys full of rain. Murderous cold rain that never stops . I watch people pass and pass, and, he recites to me, as we lay here, that all things are falling and fading, all things are going away. The rain: falling on the cold of my lips. Flash of my bone structure, the webs of my veins. His vacant eyes murmur the same thing. Cycle after cycle. Cold thought after cold thought. Speaks in pictures, my memory speaks; of the northern woods, the twilights of many colours. The depth of night like depth of soul. Now the sick wander around me. Black streets and skeltering whips of thought climb up my spine and the running rain in the gutters and what has ordained that pulse of knowing between the daily gray. When you have been thinking of someone, from so long ago, and there, they appear. That pulse, it fades so fast. Like powerful dreams fade with something we ought not see. That world hiding, before all of us were born that world was: 
	 Music with no sound. Black suns eating streams of matter, curling energy forms heaving in agency and falling into each other without names for destruction, without sight to see it, sightless and soundless and nameless music unfolding and breaking in lightless light. Like thoughts I never had talking amongst themselves. He recites things like that to me.

Wrath now brims into my eyes dark like the depth of the night. He murmurs and a dagger inside me slashes left to right. I scratch a stone until my nails bleed. Speak stone, speak or bleed. Mothlike. They hold to trees in the firelight. Then out drinking and drinking, and falling and falling and spinning and spinning and my head against the floor. 
	My sister held there in my dreams with moth wings painted on her palms and her hot green eyes in the cracks of her fingers. I wore that black dress for him before the noxious powers came to take me in the alleys. Blood moving so slow.
	Mirror of me: 
		Psoriasis on my skin and raising my arms up wildly. Trance bemused in this hot sickness. Her eyes behind the painted moths. Wrath of lostness. Take my bones for she is blonde and her eyes are so much more beautiful than I. Yes. I am the night feeding thing and she is the sun and the day. That thing I am, the thing that flies into flames. 
	When we were young we saw a farmhouse on fire in Northern Ontario. The dark smoke and everyone screaming and I cried and I cried as a storm was coming in above the flames. That night, she came into my room and climbed under the sheets and held me so soft. I wept from how soft she held me, and, she told me that a fire is not a fire. Nor a storm a storm. But is a killer a killer? Where do killers go? Who's to doom. If the judge is only me and you?
	We went west. 
	Sphinx moths clung to the lampposts at the bus stop. On the ride I told her about dreams of bears and cats in the forest. That I had a place in my stomach full of images that I could not explain. And any attempt to speak them to the world was ruinous. Out there. She left me then. 
	We split. 
	She in marble palaces. I alone to drink and walk down the silk-rain roads carrying cold embers, and a manifesto brimming in my head. Consigned to strange fires. Her tongue mocked my every step. Skelter in the night. Do you see me? Waitress with butterflies all over your skin. Nameless music. Drink one, Drink two. Tower of ivory, house of gold . Gas-town blonde. Vera. Sarah. Avalavalius. Salimsalius. Latin flower names. Then out where the water wells reflect the stars. Out where the wind keeps the killers whisper and the fireflies glow. I am out, the faun is lost in the reeds, crying for mother, slaking dogs with thirst-honed eyes follow her scent and the faun under the speckled beetle of the indifferent sky. My heart is beating wildly. Tongue dry and paralyzed before they find me. Sink your teeth into me.
	I thought I could breathe the streets into me. That I could have them for my own and they would be my own. They would fall before me. They would fall like stars fall. Before me. The face of fire is here in the alley. Coiled around him is the limitless darkness, trembling like matterless systems. Black heaven heaves in my brain. 
	I saw her out there bathing in neon light. Laughing and dancing and coloured and I saw her and everything shot in me. A folding shore, clawing its way into my skull and exploding and I was ripped to shreds. I fell to the ground and could not breathe and it was from the sky and it filled my bones. It would not go away. Shaking in the rain, the clouds filling up and falling, like cold girls on the back of my neck, like liquid beings speechless and silent filling the world with soft noise. 
	He keeps murmuring. Cycle after cycle. Cold thought after cold thought. 
	
Come back, memory. 
	Speak:
	In a canoe in the dark and quiet. Northern woods. Where I would sneak away with one of them. The sky so full of stars. Like a mother with a million babies. God it was so beautiful it filled me with a rage. I wished I had a knife and I and I could cut the black velvet of it open and drink the blood to become as beautiful as it. I opened my legs for him and my arms went back. It made me shiver and I went to wash it off in the lake. Silence in the bottom. Cold and alone in that vastness, only my head rattling like a storm. I came to him with the lake on me, backed by the night and I told him. I am your annihilation. He laughed. I thought to grab a rock and bash his head in. The face in the alleys then filled me that night. The man in all our history working his cold and terror through my every cell. The wrath of a storm from a dream where a figure had spoken to me. Telling me that all I was warned of will come to pass. Life. Unfolding. The head is a great house for lies. 
	
	Under the bridge, now. That is where I sleep. The bugs come and nip at me. Near Abbot St. Afflicted daggers of thought crowded me. Skipping through arctic growthless regions. Under whitespread wings I will give you the keys. A figure, he watches. He knows. Fee, fi, fo, fum. 
	I can seem him now. Across the way, tending me with his horror. I look away but I know I cannot. But, what can I tell you. She was the end and the beginning. And the blood that dripped when I saw it falling I wanted to take it back but the colours were lost. She consumed the empty air. It left and she was and was not again. So.() Rain. 
	The night birds are calling on the shore. I had come pale out of the water like a djinn steaming in flesh for him and standing on the throne of life and death. 
	The rain is falling. I feel that I could nearly fall away. Into the deeps. If you see him. Not when you are awake, and not when you are dreaming. Only then you will know. For what has has come already. And what has past is coming for you. What you did will be done. 
	And then I did it. The storms cry out like raped girls, burn does thunder like a madmans mind, rails of rain overflow me, flooding me like a locked basement captive in a thunderstorm, hot blood coats my legs. Arkangels. Tell me. What is the last swerve of my name? What becomes of everyone? And I did it. I did it. Time. You will see. What becomes of me? Farewell. Velvet softness, the body growing stranger, temple pulsing. My skin is still glowing with the flushes of youth, he will show me his power when he takes it away. 
 
		Her eyes were so beautiful. More than anything in the world. That villain of her beauty. The coldness of it. The knowing of it. It made my stomach ache. Though she held me. I. I had to bring them back. Into the ocean. They had to go back to the ocean. The flesh of food. The blood of every drink. Devotion to wreck you. Burn you up and rip you to shreds. And so have you ever thought about the wolves that fly through the snow and the snow exploding and the trees are in terror of them, the heavens and stars slow their burnings when they run to not overtake their light for they are the terror to the forest when they run, beauty and only blood on their minds and life in their hearts and the deer must dance the dance of their lives for they are coming and they do not know they are the wolves they are without needing to know and I lay in the sun in the such a state I fear no one on earth has ever felt but old Delphian's screaming in old smoke about sensations of life found through the body's aching and written in secrets in words and if not speak it it comes like a legion of terribles into your heart and blackens it and whips and fall I fell my sister in those leather boots and her pale thighs and her hair so perfect and smoking in the corner with the others all dressed in monotones somewhere in places I could never know places without images or heads without shapes in them from somewhere and feel like they're bleeding if they don't sink into ultimate anything ultimate pain 
or ultimate anything at all and then I saw her eyes bleeding in my head I saw her torn to pieces God the nights when the storms roll in from the distance like they're full of black horses with riders that cursed the earth and heavens and they rush through the electric vault charged and wild seething in ecstasy and they ride like villains in the smoke of cloud and the skeltering whips of rain flowing in vapours to nowhere and I feel them in my bones I feel them out there rushing against the world and they could find me and devour me and then escape from the wrath of the Law of which they come from freeing themselves daily from the endless vault of pain into a lesser place that I can see so perfectly tell them I'm sorry though I am not sorry I don't know what I am or what is this world is only when it is raining do you feel it truly when the rain comes is when I saw him in the rain and when the farmhouse caught fire and the stars and the riders and the frogs beating heart took over me and like a black crocodile with their wild eyes and it became of me and I wish I didn't but I did and she was sleeping and I saw her there and then the riders riding and the hallway not coated in blood but blood she was still after the choking and on the floor so strangely just not moving and out with I took her phone and ran and fled and at the ocean I went into the water and put my legs into the water and stood there like a seabird out there alone with no people for the winter is cold and full of rain and I saw into the shadows they were flicking with little spots of light and I turned to see the moon that burned above me full and cold and burning my eyes eating it I was having it for myself to have as my own see then this feeling this agony ultimate taking over me to see if this is what it wanted and I was crying and the tears were falling and a tear hit the ocean and water dripped into it and I turned back and some blood on my hands and I washed in the water was so cold on my legs were frozen 
and then I walked down the streets and everyone was out drinking and playing sweetness and crooked hands from crooked worlds came to grab at me and my smile like a pain it was rotten I could not contain it my eyes went black and I walked with it full over me autonomy taking me the sea in the summer we'd go up north in the forests and out to the marshes the reeds and grasshoppers were jumping and she in her white dress laughing and we use to run together like birds of God and speak like children because we were children and she whispered to me about a man that had her and did everything to her and I threw up into my hands and asked if it felt like dying and she looked strangely at me and I wiped the puke off on the reeds then you waited for her in the trees in the dead of night when she was angry and she ran out and I came to find her and she was torn up from whatever you were a wolf or a man or a wolf is not a wolf nor a man a man they are something else that is trying to get out to be its ultimate thing there are dealers here on the corner that give them there fixes and wallowing and plastic fires and burning like a batman could wander through and write cryptic signs on alley way walls about a storm that is coming a storm that is so at ready to burst forth from all things unsaid we run away as it comes closer skeletons dancing and the ruins and the screams and the sickness growing in all out hearts Allmuzifulallahjohmselum paint me dreamer blacksnakes tangled in my heart and oval in the corner of the room ask it questions and it will answer you floods and fires falling from the sky wail the days a killer a mother a lawyer and artist a child box them and tell them what they are until we go moving into the muck only vicious visions crowding us tell them book one book book two tell them you love them carry them like a child and put them on the altar stone the daughter he killed to burn down the walls and he wept and turned to the crowd for glory walking now through the battered ruins in a park the trees so beautiful but I cannot see anything but the thing I've done and things like snakes or those black fairies skinny in the trees climbing up the skinny trees and singing haunting things that fill your brains the shore nymphs cover up your ears with honey or die listening to the waves on a beautiful beach with a beautiful person just holding and a soft life without the fight you will rip your eyes out of your head and scare the beautiful person half to death she was with me always when I was scared I thought every time I said what was hiding she would eat my heart and her eyes would go wide but 
she just said that it's ok but then what had I left to seek but the snakes inside to seek and they come out everyday or tangle together a thousand tangled up together. In dreams, then I wake to the rain. And my body is on me and my head and thoughts are real too like sleeping things but with a body and blood in it. Yes. Others too that spoke with there tongues all black and they'd come from angels yes the world came from them and it had been a secret to me until I met the rain inside my stomach and spoke to me that I could breathe it in and I would dissolve away that I could drink through breath its blood and it would then pulse through me and what it looks like they see to see me in sweet duress and the eyes half-closed and whispering safeness into my ear that all things are here and there is no pain anymore and all childhood came alight with the sky and the flowers and laughing and scared and flowers and he was what which saved from this for only moments. Blood that could dream a life from breathing in of higher air the way they all fall to it in blue and those paintings of masterpieces but I am a killer a killer and the killer finds it for the killer knows the racking and the wrenching of a creature that is not here it knows the black structure the flesh in wrapped plastic in the supermarkets and it sets its work upon you and the fires and the fires that flood you when you know you know and you know that the World is not a World I see blue and red lights now. On the road to the entrance of the park. Something always failing us. I am painted with some dark spots. With colours and webs. Stems attempting to breach to somewhere else. From here or there. And all connected. Some colours, some lost. I am a stray dog that cannot marvel at the stars. Missing. And he fell because there was something in his heart. Something like maps of things. Maps of things not of any discipline. Just maps he can't express. Maps within maps and all he saw in every path was corruption. Better to show them what someone can become. Better to see my sister leave to show them that above is rotting and so below rots too. And I saw her before in the motel room. She was only a child. I looked through the window and he looked like drugs and she was laughing reciting those old plays she'd know about the daughter left for sacrifice. She put the dramatists mask over her face and then moved backwards back the corner of the room like a spider and posing there with lamplight on her body. I can't explain anymore. I see the flashlights coming now. I can hear the dogs barking out there in the dark. They will come to me, the animals of the authority. I will be their eucharist. They can taste the flesh that became spirit for taking the spirit in flesh away. I will give them my neck for their fangs as if it was my whole heart and they will make a statue of me where the alleyways are a statue to remember that none shall be forgiven in this world or the next. You can pass through this world with only a small fire burning. As you walk to sunless mansions, sunless seas, starved heart and starved eyes carrying your embers moving from night to night where no soul walks save me.
