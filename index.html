Yes. But you never saw the way I went crawling through intactile places. With shades that spoke in shapes and soft fingers climbing up my thighs. You never saw the starlight up north where the stars pulse in blues and the pines stand eerie in the dark of the night.  The lakes blurred by the heavens. Like a liquid crown of that endless light and strangeness. That was before this, before I speak this through into nothing. And, I'm not sure of this place. All the figures of life have faded. And I am lost in here. Lost in the alleys full of rain. Murderous cold rain that leaks down the lampposts. He would recite to me, as we lay there,  that all things were changing and fading and falling and we were all dying. Everyday everyone was dying. The rain: falling on the cold of my lips. Makes my bones shiver. I see water on the windows. I see his vacant eyes and hear him murmuring the same things. Cycle after cycle. Cold thought after cold thought. My memory is in the northern woods. Not here. Where the sick go wandering. It is in the twilights of m any colours. Depth of night like depth of soul. I could feel an emptiness being filled up in my bones. Before the black streets and the wailing made me think all nights about a thing not made of stone or hearts that had its hold on us. In some way or not in that way that it had been thought like a pulse you feel or when something comes like a face when you had just been thinking of them but it fades so fast like the most powerful dreams with something else seem to wash away as if you never were to see it the work too much it seems like the world before anything the visionless world like music with no sound black suns eating streams of psychic matter and curling energy forms falling into each other 
without names nameless and sightless thoughtless music unfolding and breaking in lightless light no one to see it no one to know the thoughts you never had talking amongst themselves he saw the pain then work inside of me like a dagger cutting my insides left and right and the blood not coming out scratching at a stone till you make your nails bleed and weeping and waking and coming back to the stone and ripping at your nails and then 
out drinking and drinking and falling and spinning and my head against the floor and waking again without a world I think there is a mouse in the walls ceiling light feels hot on my legs its heat against my thighs I wore that black dress he gave me though I was skinny like a starved dog and the blood moving real slow in me from only cups of noodles and sips of water and looking at the psoriasis on my skin in the mirror and raising my arms up wildly in a kind of trance where my sister is now well a great beauty yes blonde and eyes like huge mirrors of love and when we were young the farmhouse caught fire a fire flowing in dark smoke and I started crying and she came to me that night. She held me there. 
And I wept and she told me a fire is not a fire nor a storm is a storm and then I just cried for hours and hours and she held me and we went West for dad and mum were not so and the bus ride I told her about dreams of bears and cats in the forests and that I could be a thousand things and off she was with the boys when we came there and I alone to drink and drink while walking down the roads a clock tower and a manifesto brimming in my head and she was blonde and I was dark like angels of some kind then a thousand more days were aching away and I grew strange to him and him to me and that was it my sister lay on marble stones somewhere high and the chains I wore consigned me to strange f
ires that burned against the night and through a thousand birthing's I went dying days were aching away where the water wells reflect the stars out where the wind keeps a killers whisper on its many tongues and the fireflies are lofting and you hear a cry from the faun lost in the reeds and the dogs are hunting with those soulless eyes thirsting and slaking and the fauns eyes sucking up the starlight its heart beating wildly its tongue dry and falling paralyzed before they come over him sink your teeth into me the fireworks shot out and the bars and the streets and I thought I could breath and they would fall before me or be inside me and then I could twist and turn them and make them my own and see the face of fire unknown burning beneath my skin like dogs running through the snow and the deer with their terrored eyes dancing and flying against the cold and the wind and the pack comes hot with that marvel and fear and beauty and I saw her seeing what she knew I ought to be and I thought I saw what she saw of me and I wasn't what could come of me and then everything shot out and there was a folding shore unfolding with tongues licking against something and things like tongues or fire licks 
compressed into a ball and hands trying to claw out this pressure of matter in a violence coming out of my skull and setting itself against the world and I saw her dancing and arms around her waist and smiling and laughing like she was bathing in a neon world and my head went into itself and I fell to the ground and shivered and I was spinning on the earth and the pain came as if from the sky and filled my whole body with it and it rented my body and it would not go away for days speaking out of me to me as if you are here but nothing is there waiting for me and I don't know what it is or were I just to be seen as a flower made of blood and skin and not anything else besides the rain will take it all away no matter what it is the rain will take it and that feeling when I had another I had we went in the canoe in the dark and quiet we were sneaking there were laws above us that made it a great play like stealing away and then we made a fire and the sky was so f
ull of stars I could've cried it was so full like a mother with a million babies and the babies were light and silent and only I was their almost weeping and it made me angry too it made me wish to cut it open with a knife and let it bleed and I could drink the blood and become as beautiful as it and he was kissing my neck it made me shiver and I felt like a stray dog come into a house just a slave to love and I opened my legs and my arms went back and after I went into the water to wash it all off of me and the silent form like shadows of fish all around me like I a sun and they my planets and stretching to the shores the trees on my skin and the ocean I am something of all things and all things are in me but black it came life itself and I shuttered with fear and I told him I am loosing my mind the hours and hours and hours unfolding pulses come from somewhere up my legs like a monster in me the wrath of it shooting up my spine and speaking through me about a storm about a dream where a figure had told me about my life and I woke and I could not remember what he said too late to know under the bridge where I sleep has bugs that float and nip at me. The speckled beetles with their shiny backs like stardust and glowing 
 blue a little under the streetlamps and there is a figure that watches me and I can see him across the way and he watches me and he knows me and he tends me with a horror of what he wants and I look away for what can I tell you is the blood that dripped when I did and I saw it falling I wanted to take it back take it away but the colours were lost and she consumed the empty air and the form disappeared and when the night birds rest upon the shore all black I had come pale out of the water I like to think about it in the site of him coming out just like a djinn out of the lake to him and in him so much wanting I ruled him entirely and entirely I was his. There are children and teachers that I speak to at night some outside and some within. Heaven like a tree with roots going all the way down and up in the desert there were figures and I lay in the sun in the such a state I fear no one on earth has ever felt but old manics screaming in old books about sensations of life found through the body's aching and written in secrets in words and if not speak it it comes like a legion of terribles into your heart and blackens it and whips and fall I fell my sister in those leather boots and her pale thighs and her hair so perfect and smoking in the corner with the others all dressed in monotones somewhere in places I could never know places without images or heads without shapes in them from somewhere and feel like they're bleeding if they don't sink into ultimate anything ultimate pain 
or ultimate anything at all and the I saw her eyes bleeding in my head I saw her torn to pieces God the nights when the storms roll in from the distance like they're full of black horses with riders that cursed the earth and heavens and they rush through the electric vault charged and wild seething in ecstasy and they ride like villains in the smoke of cloud and the skeltering whips of rain flowing like vaporous beings to nowhere and I feel them in my bones I feel them out there rushing against the world and they could find me and devour me and then escape from the wrath of the Law of which they come from freeing themselves daily from the endless vault of pain into a lesser place that I can see so perfectly tell them I'm sorry though I am not sorry I don't know what I am or what is this world is only when it is raining do you feel it truly when the rain comes is when I saw him in the rain and when the farmhouse caught fire and the stars and the riders and the frogs beating heart took over me and like a black crocodile with their wild eyes and it became of me and I wish I didn't but I did and she was sleeping and I saw her there and then the riders riding and the hallway not coated in blood but blood she was still after the choking and on the floor so strangely just not moving and out with I took her phone and ran and fled and at the ocean I went into the water and put my legs into the water and stood there like a seabird out there alone with no people for the winter is cold and full of rain and I saw into the shadows they were flicking with little spots of light and I turned to see the moon that burned above me full and cold and burning my eyes eating it I was having it for myself to have as my own see then this feeling this agony ultimate taking over me to see if this is what it wanted and I was crying and the tears were falling and a tear hit the ocean and water dripped into it and I turned back and some blood on my hands and I washed in the water was so cold on my legs were frozen 
and then I walked down the streets and everyone was out drinking and playing sweetness and crooked hands from crooked worlds came to grab at me and my smile like a pain it was rotten I could not contain it my eyes went black and I walked with it full over me autonomy taking me the sea in the summer we'd go up north in the forests and out to the marshes the reeds and grasshoppers were jumping and she in her white dress laughing and we use to run together like birds of God and speak like children because we were children and she whispered to me about a man that had her and did everything to her and I threw up into my hands and asked if it felt like dying and she looked strangely at me and I wiped the puke off on the reeds then you waited for her in the trees in the dead of night when she was angry and she ran out and I came to find her and she was torn up from whatever you were a wolf or a man or a wolf is not a wolf nor a man a man they are something else that is trying to get out to be its ultimate thing there are dealers here on the corner that give them there fixes and wallowing and plastic fires and burning like a batman could wander through and write cryptic signs on alley way walls about a storm that is coming a storm that is so at ready to burst forth from all things unsaid we run away as it comes closer skeletons dancing and the ruins and the screams and the sickness growing in all out hearts Allmuzifulallahjohmselum paint me dreamer blacksnakes tangled in my heart and oval in the corner of the room ask it questions and it will answer you floods and fires falling from the sky wail the days a killer a mother a lawyer and artist a child box them and tell them what they are until we go moving into the muck only vicious visions crowding us tell them book one book book two tell them you love them carry them like a child and put them on the altar stone the daughter he killed to burn down the walls and he wept and turned to the crowd for glory walking now through the battered ruins in a park the trees so beautiful but I cannot see anything but the thing I've done and things like snakes or those black fairies skinny in the trees climbing up the skinny trees and singing haunting things that fill your brains the shore nymphs cover up your ears with honey or die listening to the waves on a beautiful beach with a beautiful person just holding and a soft life without the fight you will rip your eyes out of your head and scare the beautiful person half to death she was with me always when I was scared I thought every time I said what was hiding she would eat my heart and her eyes would go wide but 
she just said that it's ok but then what had I left to seek but the snakes inside to seek and they come out everyday or tangle together a thousand tangled up together. In dreams, then I wake to the rain. And my body is on me and my head and thoughts are real too like sleeping things but with a body and blood in it. Yes. Others too that spoke with there tongues all black and they'd come from angels yes the world came from them and it had been a secret to me until I met the rain inside my stomach and spoke to me that I could breathe it in and I would dissolve away. T
t  hat I could drink through breath its blood and it would then pulse through me and what it looks like they see to see me in sweet duress and the eyes half-closed and whispering safeness into my ear that all things are here and there is no pain anymore and all childhood came alight with the sky and the flowers and laughing and scared and flowers and he was what which saved from this for only moments. Blood that could dream a life from breathing in of higher air the way they all fall to it in blue and those paintings of masterpieces but I am a killer a killer and the killer finds it for the killer knows the racking and the wrenching of a creature that is not here it knows the black structure the flesh in wrapped plastic in the supermarkets and it sets its work upon you and the fires and the fires that flood you when you know you know and you know that the World is not a World I see blue and red lights now. On the road to the entrance of the park. Something always failing us. I am painted with some dark spots. With colours and webs. Stems attempting to breach to somewhere else. From here or there. And all connected. Some colours, some lost. I am a stray dog that cannot marvel at the stars. Missing. And he fell because there was something in his heart. Something like maps of things. Maps of things not of any discipline. Just maps he can't express. Maps within maps and all he saw in every path was corruption. Better to show them what someone can become. Better to see my sister leave to show them that above is rotting and so below rots too. And I saw her before in the motel room. She was only a child. I looked through the window and he looked like drugs and she was laughing reciting those old plays she'd know about the daughter left for sacrifice. She put the dramatists mask over her face and then moved backwards back the corner of the room like a spider and posing there with lamplight on her body. I can't explain anymore. I see the flashlights coming now. I can hear the dogs barking out there in the dark. They will come to me, the animals of the authority. I will be their eucharist. They can taste the flesh that became spirit for taking the spirit in flesh away. I will give them my neck for their fangs as if it was my whole heart and they will make a statue of me where the alleyways are a statue to remember that none shall be forgiven in this world or the next. You can pass through this world with only a small fire burning. As you walk to sunless mansions, sunless seas, starved heart and starved eyes carrying your embers moving from night to night where no soul walks save me.
